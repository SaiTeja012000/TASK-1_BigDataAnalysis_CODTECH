#DESCRIPTION OF TASK_1 : Big Data Analysis on IPL â€“ Project Description

In this project, I performed in-depth data analysis on Indian Premier League (IPL) datasets using Big Data tools and techniques to derive meaningful insights. My role involved collecting, cleaning, processing, and analyzing large volumes of historical IPL data, including player statistics, match results, team performance, and venue records.

I started by gathering data from reliable online sources and structured it using tools like Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for storage and Apache Hive for data querying. I used Apache Spark for fast in-memory processing to handle large datasets efficiently. Data preprocessing included handling missing values, standardizing formats, and filtering irrelevant data to ensure high data quality.

Once the data was prepared, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python (with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn) to identify trends and patterns. I visualized key insights such as top-performing players, most successful teams, player strike rates, economy rates of bowlers, and win percentages across venues. I also analyzed factors influencing match outcomes, such as toss decisions, home-ground advantage, and player combinations.

Additionally, I implemented machine learning models using Spark MLlib to predict match outcomes based on historical data. I experimented with different algorithms like logistic regression and decision trees, evaluating them using metrics like accuracy and F1-score to choose the best-performing model.

Throughout the project, I focused on optimizing query performance, parallel processing of data, and ensuring scalability for future IPL seasons. I presented the findings through interactive dashboards using Tableau, allowing stakeholders to explore the insights dynamically.

This project enhanced my skills in handling real-world large-scale datasets, applying Big Data frameworks, and deriving actionable insights from sports data. It also strengthened my ability to work with both structured and unstructured data while effectively communicating technical findings to a non-technical audience.
